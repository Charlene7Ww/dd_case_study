# **Business Prompt (for practice)**

## Business Context

You are a **Media Analytics Analyst** on DoorDash’s CPG Ads & Promotions team. Your team partners with CPG advertisers to help them understand how their campaigns perform, and to provide reco mmendations to improve customer experience and ROI.

As part of a recent promotion initiative, DoorDash provided **discounts to customers** through CPG-sponsored campaigns. The goal was to drive more orders, improve customer satisfaction, and ideally increase Dasher (driver) engagement through better tips and delivery economics.

You’ve been given a sample dataset of recent On-Demand orders. You’ve been asked to help the internal team evaluate the effectiveness of this promotion.

1. Do discounts increase or decrease revenue (Net Revenue / AOV / GMV)?
2. Do discounts affect customer behavior (new customer rate, refund rate, tipping)?
3. Is there a relationship between delivery time and refund behavior?
4. Are there regional differences that suggest a differentiated promotion strategy?

## Dataset

Each row represents a customer order. The columns include:

- `order_id`
- `order_placed_time`
- `order_delivered_time`
- `total_amount_usd`
- `discount_applied_usd`
- `tip_amount_usd`
- `refunded_amount_usd`
- `is_asap` (boolean: True = ASAP, False = Scheduled)
- Other order-level metadata

## Questions

1. **Campaign Effectiveness** 
   Do discounts increase or decrease revenue (Net Revenue / AOV / GMV)?  

2. **Tipping Behavior** 
   Does providing a discount influence customer tipping behavior?  

3. **Operational Impact** 
   Do longer delivery times correlate with higher refund rates?  

4. **Recommendations** 
   What would you suggest to improve future promotions?
